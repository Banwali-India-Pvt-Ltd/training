# In this program code run after reading symbols
'''
=>Here first symbol is \n which means when the compiler will get
symbol \n the compiler will leave current line and will move to the
next line
=> Second symbol is \t (tab space) which means when the compiler will get symbol
\t (tab space) the compiler will make a space of tap and after that will print or read
next letter
=> Third symbol is \b (back space) which means when the compiler will get symbol \b
 the compiler will delete letter which has before \b
=> Forth symbol is \a ( for alert ) which means when the compiler will get
symbol \a the compiler will make a single space in the current line

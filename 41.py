# In this program the two operator are the same but they have equal
# precedence

# I got a doubt in just first equation why result in -5

print(2-3) - 4  # it should give result + 5 instead of -5
print 2-(3-4)   # it gives +3 which is correct

print(-3 + 2)   # it gives result -1 which is correct
print(-(3 + 2))  # it gives result -5 which is correct

# The program related to operator precedence and associativity
# It clear that which operator will go first & get result

print 2 + 3 * 4  # It will multiply first after that it will add

print (2+3) * 4  # It will add first after that it will multiply

print 2-3-4     # It will get total first - operator after that it will
                # check weather the number of plus operator greater than - operator
                # if + operator is greater than - operator then the
                # result will in the plus else in minus

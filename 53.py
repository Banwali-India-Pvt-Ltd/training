# In this program given assignment in the book
# first define value and print it by several ways

x = 2   # store value 2 in x
print("x")   # print a str type x
print('x')   # print str type x
print(x)     # print store value in x
print("x + 1")  # print str type



# Error in this statement  print('x' + 1)   # print x str and int 1
# but if I print(x + 1)  then why not prints and showing error
#print(x + 1) it is showing error
